// FIRST:

// However, I do not recommend using the `inquirer` package that's
// listed in the above help article. It's out of date and the new
// package, while easy to use, is hard to set up since it's written
// in a newer style. This will send you down an unneccessary rabbit
// hole. Just stick to using the "node:readline" package.

// You can run the program by clicking on the "Run" button at the top
// of this Replit page.
//
// THIRD:
// Implement your program inside of rock-paper-scissors.js.
