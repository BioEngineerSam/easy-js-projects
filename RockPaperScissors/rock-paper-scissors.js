// This is making use of the native `readline` NodeJS package.
// (Note: NodeJS is a JavaScript runtime â€“ a program that can
// execute JavaScript code.)
//
// NodeJS comes with a set of packages pre-installed that extend
// the core functionality of the language. We can make use of
// those packages by `require`ing it with the package name.
//
// "node:readline" is the package that we want in this case to
// help us prompt the user for an input.
const readline = require("node:readline");

// This bit of code creates a readline object that allows us to
// ask for user input and output. It's pretty low-level and
// close to the rails, so we have to do things like supply it
// an `input` and `output` to tell the readline package what
// to use to ask for inputs from the user and the output that
// the user can observe.
const rl = readline.createInterface({
  // In this case, `process.stdin` and `process.stdout` is used.
  // stdin and stdout are the colloquial abbreviations used in
  // most languages to indicate the standard stream that programs
  // will write to. (For example, A `console.log` in a NodeJS
  // program will write to stdout.)
  //
  // It's an abbreviation for "Standard In" and "Standard Out".
  // Don't worry too much about this block of code for this
  // project. But I've given you just enough context so you
  // aren't completely in the dark about what's going on.

  output: process.stdout,
